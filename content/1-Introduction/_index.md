The intent of the workshops is to educate users about AWS Networking.

A background in Networking (IP Addressing, Subnetting, VPN, Security, and Routing) is useful but not required.

There are three workshops:

1. [Foundational](/fundamentals): Overview of AWS Networking; covering VPCs, connecting VPCs and data centers, security controls, and network monitoring.
2. [AWS Gateway Load Balancer](/gwlb): transparently deploy and scale appliances, such as firewalls, in the AWS network.
3. [AWS Transit Gateway Multicast](/multicast): Explore how Transit gateway can act as a rendezvous point for multicast sources and receivers within your AWS VPCs.
